# Easy Deployment Method (Shared Link Only)

tutorial: https://youtu.be/5zfjZs_8gLQ?si=teAjbtEK1rtRBUpt

Use this method if you only want to access public MEGA shared links and don't need a MEGA account.
1. Copy the latest `worker.js` from:
   [**worker.js**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/developeranaz/MEGA-INDEX-CLOUDFLARE/refs/heads/main/worker.js)
2. Sign in to your **Cloudflare Dashboard**:
   [**dash.cloudflare.com**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
3. Go to **Workers & Pages** → **Create Application**.
4. Select **Start with Hello World!** and click **Get Started**.
5. Enter a name for your Worker (optional) and click **Deploy**.
6. After deployment, click **Edit Code**.
7. Delete the default contents of `worker.js`.
8. Paste the copied `worker.js` code.
9. Click **Deploy** to publish the Worker.
10. Wait a minute for the deployment to finish.
11. Click **Visit** to open your MEGA Cloudflare Index.

# Method 2: Mega Shared Link only mode (no account required)

## 🚀 One-click deploy

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/developeranaz/MEGA-INDEX-CLOUDFLARE)

Clicking the button will:

1. Clone this repository into your own GitHub account.
2. Let you pick a Worker name and confirm settings.
3. Build and deploy it to your Cloudflare account automatically.

No environment variables or secrets are needed — it works out of the box.

> **Note:** For the button to work, this repository must be **public** on GitHub.

## What it does

- **Landing page** at `/` — paste any public mega.nz link to index it.
- **Folder links** (`https://mega.nz/folder/HANDLE#KEY`) → a browsable file index.
- **File links** (`https://mega.nz/file/HANDLE#KEY`) → an index page showing the file name and size, with a download button.
- Streams downloads directly through the Worker with HTTP range support (resumable / multi-threaded download friendly).

## Manual deploy (alternative)

If you'd rather deploy from your own machine:

```bash
npm install
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler deploy
```

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and a Cloudflare account.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local URL Wrangler prints (usually `http://localhost:8787`).

## Project structure

```
.
├── worker.js        # The Cloudflare Worker (all app logic + UI)
├── wrangler.toml    # Worker configuration (name, entry point, compat date)
└──  package.json     # Scripts and Wrangler dependency

```

# Additional Deployment Method (Shared Link Only)

## 🚀 Performance Test

The worker was tested using **Google Colab** with **aria2** multi-threaded downloading (`-x 13`).

- **Average download speed:** **44 MiB/s**
- **Multi-threaded connections:** **13**
- **Large file tested:** **6+ GB**
- **Result:** The download completed successfully, demonstrating support for downloading very large files.

> **Note:** During multi-threaded downloads, a few connections may report temporary `Got EOF from the server` errors. This is expected with parallel range requests and does not affect the final download, which completes successfully.
